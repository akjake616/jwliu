This work presents the design and synthesis of convex metallic reflectarray antennas for multi-beam radiation using the steepest descent method (SDM). Reflectarray antennas, consisting of metallic reflecting elements, are engineered for high energy efficiency and broad bandwidth. The synthesis procedure optimizes the phase distribution across the reflectarray elements to achieve multiple beams, addressing the need for multi-sector coverage in millimeter-wave (mmWave) applications. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving desirable radiation patterns with improved directivity, and reducing sidelobe levels through optimized element configurations.
