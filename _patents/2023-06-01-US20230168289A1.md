A calibration and group testing system for RF units and a method therefor are provided. The system includes a control device, a signal source device, a test platform, and a measurement device. M times of measurements are performed between the test platform and the measurement device. For each measurement, a microwave signal source is converted into random microwave signals with N random amplitudes and phases, and the RF units are respectively stimulated to output the random microwave signals superimposed on a measured path to form a measurement signal. The measurement device receives measurement signals of the M times of measurements and converts them into M pieces of measurement information, respectively. The control device solves the measurement information and performs iterative and convergent calculations on all solution results to obtain calibration information of the RF units in a specific state, thereby correcting the RF units according to the calibration information.
