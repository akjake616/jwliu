A device for testing a group of radio-frequency (RF) chip modules and a method for using the same is disclosed. The device includes a signal analyzer, a power divider, control ICs, a signal controller, and a power combiner. The power divider receives an RF signal and transmits RF input signals to the RF chip modules and the control ICs in response to the RF signal. The signal controller controls each control IC to adjust at least one of the power and the phase of the corresponding RF input signal, thereby generating an RF output signal. The power combiner receives the RF output signal from each control IC to generate a test signal. The signal analyzer receives the test signal and obtains RF properties corresponding to at least one of the power and the phase of each RF output signal.
