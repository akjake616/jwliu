A calibration method for a phased array of antennas, wherein the phased array of antennas comprises N antenna elements, the N antenna elements are decomposed into G sub-arrays, each of the G sub-arrays comprises M antenna elements, and the calibration method comprises: (a) inputting a set of digital control codes to RF devices in order to produce field signals corresponding to an operation order r to the G sub-arrays' radiations; (b) measuring the observation field signals of the G sub-arrays corresponding to the operation order r in a fixed position to produce a DFT relationship with respect to the RF devices' operations; and (c) repeating operations (a) to (b) corresponding to the operation order r from 1 to G for generating error-calibrating signals corresponding to the signals of the G sub-arrays.
