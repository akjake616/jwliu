The present invention discloses an RF element group testing system and method. The method comprises steps: adding an identification feature to a first RF signal, which is output by one of the plurality of tested RF elements, to generate an identification RF signal; synthesizing the identification RF signal and a second RF signal, which is output by each of the rest of the tested RF elements, to generate a corresponding synthesis signal; resolving the synthesis signal into the identification RF signal and the corresponding second RF signal according to the identification feature; restoring the identification RF signal into the first RF signal; and calculating at least one signal-feature parameter of the first RF signal and the second RF signal.
