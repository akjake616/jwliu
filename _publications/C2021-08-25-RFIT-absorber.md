This paper presents a design of periodic circuit analog absorbers (PCAAs) for electromagnetic (EM) scattering fields reduction. The performance sensitivities to the geometric parameters in fabrications are examined to estimate the manufacturing uncertainty. We consider randomly nonuniform thicknesses of a conductive ink and the two sandwiching dielectric substrate layers on both sides to fabricate PCAAs. The EM absorbing capability is studied on the S-parameters (the reflection and transmission coefficients) and the resulting power efficiency, using numerical HFSS full-wave simulations at a frequency band of 10 GHz. Experiments on prototype samples are also conducted. They showed that a fabrication accuracy of better than 1e−4λ is required to assure a stable performance.
