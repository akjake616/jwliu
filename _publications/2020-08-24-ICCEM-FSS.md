This paper presents a methodology to model electromagnetic (EM) frequency selective surfaces (FSS) in terms of equivalent dielectric materials, which can be used to perform fast EM scattering analysis when the FSS is integrated with other antennas. This modeling provides an efficient way to simulate large FSS, where full-wave analysis is required. In the approximation, the transmission and reflection coefficients of the FSS element under an infinite array assumption are first calculated by commercial tools, and afterward genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to resemble the FSS by a dielectric substrate with proper permittivity, permeability and loss tangent. Thus, the equivalent dielectric surface can replace the original FSS in order to evaluate the performance of the antenna structure such as the radar cross-section (RCS).
