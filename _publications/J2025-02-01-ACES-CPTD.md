A unified framework for implementing circularly polarized plane wave sources in time-domain electromagnetic simulations is presented. Unlike traditional approaches that require separate settings for the orthogonal components as different sources, our method integrates circular polarization states represented in frequency domain seamlessly into time-domain simulations. We also studied the effectiveness of the approach when broadband sources are used. This framework is applicable to both finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) methods.
