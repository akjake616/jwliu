In this paper, an efficient method of field pattern interpolation is presented to calibrate the antenna radiation measured by sparse intervals. The technique takes the measurement in far field which lessens the interference caused by the measure antenna (MA). The sparse measurement is determined by the characteristics of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) between an aperture and its far-field radiation, by which the positions to measure the antenna radiation can be given for minimum efforts, and the measurement can be accelerated to acquire the field pattern. The procedure is outlined and some numerical examples are given to validate the method.
