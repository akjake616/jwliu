In this paper, we present the design of metallic reflectarray antennas consisting of convex nonresonant elements to radiate multiple beams with optimum radiation gains and relatively orthogonal overlapping. In particular, an antenna is realized at 38 GHz to provide sufficient gains and beam widths for simultaneous link-budget and radio coverage satisfaction in the applications of fifth-generation mobile communications. The pattern optimization employs the steepest decent method (SDM) to optimize the phases of reflecting elements for gain tradeoff. The SDM procedure is very efficient because relatively simple formulations of analysis in closed form are developed to subsequently update the phases in each iteration. This procedure avoids the cumbersome and numerous full-wave numerical simulations of scattering fields. Design examples and their radiation characteristics are presented to demonstrate the concepts and validate the feasibility.
