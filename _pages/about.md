Currently engaged in a postdoctoral position specializing in optical simulations, with a focus on the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method. Dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge technology to drive innovation and exploration in this dynamic field.


My doctoral thesis focuses on the development of algorithms designed for the rapid calibration of antenna arrays. I have a keen interest in electromagetic theory, digital communications and programming.


I am also a dedicated software developer with a primary focus on Julia programming, excelling in creating high-performance solutions for numerical and scientific computing challenges. Additionally, I am exploring the JavaScript ecosystem to enhance my web development skills and integrate dynamic functionalities into my projects.
