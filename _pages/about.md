Currently engaged in a postdoctoral position specializing in optical simulations, with a focus on the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method. Dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge technology to drive innovation and exploration in this dynamic field.


My doctoral thesis centers on developing algorithms for the rapid calibration of antenna arrays. My primary research interests include antenna measurement theory, phased array calibration, computational electromagnetics, and biomedical optics.


I am also a dedicated software developer with a primary focus on Julia programming, excelling in creating high-performance solutions for numerical and scientific computing challenges. Additionally, I am exploring the JavaScript ecosystem to enhance my web development skills and integrate dynamic functionalities into my projects.
